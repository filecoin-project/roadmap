This repo is designed as a collaborative space to create, track, and update a community roadmap for the Filecoin project.

## About the Roadmap

It includes top-level milestones across many aspects of the Filecoin protocol, tooling ecosystem, and network capabilities - focused on how they benefit and unlock notable added capabilities of Filecoin.

It is generated by creating different github issues (across multiple projects/repos) for each major milestone, improvement category, and roadmap "root" - and visualizing them via starmap.site/<roadmap root url> (ex https://github.com/filecoin-project/roadmap/issues/1)
